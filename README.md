### Making a pull request

Make sure you have all of your work committed on a local branch:

```
git status
git add .
git commit -m "my great new work"
```

Once that's done, you need to send that information to Github via:

```
git push origin <name of branch>
```

From there use the GUI on Github.com to set up a pull request.
